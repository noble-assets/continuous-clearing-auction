# CCA Improvement Proposals (CIPs)

The goal of the CIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for teams building on the Continuous Clearing Auction (CCA) protocol. Standards around LBPStrategies and periphery contracts are included.

**All CIPs are optional.**  CIPs are and will always remain optional standards for teams building on CCA.
